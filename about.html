                        <strong>I grew up in Alexandria, Egypt.</strong> I graduated from El Quds International School
                        in 2023 before being
                        accepted into the Faculty of Engineering at Alexandria University. From a young age, I‚Äôve had a
                        strong
                        interest in Mathematics and Physics, along with a curiosity about programming, coding, and the
                        many fields
                        of computer science. After completing my first year at university, I decided to major in
                        Mechatronics, as
                        I wanted to learn more about robot mechanisms, programming, and the control of robotic systems.

                        My goal is to develop a wide range of skills and take as many courses as possible to prepare
                        myself for the
                        job market after graduation. In the near future, I plan to take CS50‚Äôs <i>Introduction to
                            Artificial Intelligence
                            with Python</i> to deepen my understanding of machine learning and gain experience designing
                        intelligent systems.
                        Looking ahead, my long-term goal is to build a career as either a freelance programmer or an AI
                        engineer,
                        where I can apply my knowledge to solve real-world problems and continue growing in the
                        ever-evolving field of technology.

                        One of my strengths is having a strong memory. I can usually remember important information, as
                        well as events and dates from things I‚Äôve experienced, which is quite useful. I also enjoy
                        problem-solving and figuring out different ways to tackle challenges. On top of that, I like
                        being creative, whether it‚Äôs designing an outfit or building a webpage, I enjoy making
                        things visually appealing and presentable.

                        Through university and CS50, I‚Äôve also picked up some technical skills. So far, I‚Äôve learned
                        coding in <strong>C</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>, working with <strong>SQL databases</strong>
                        , and building websites with <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</strong>

                        I've always been inspired by my amazing parents who are also engineers. They helped me find my
                        passion and
                        the path I want to follow. I would also be completely lost without my friends who always support
                        and
                        encourage me to keep going, spending my university days with them makes everything so much more
                        fun
                        and memorable.<br>
                        As for a fun fact: I really enjoy surprising people with gifts or making something special for
                        them that I know
                        they‚Äôll love. It‚Äôs one of my favorite ways to make others happy.
